Top places to go and travel would be Tokyo, Bangkok, and Bali!
I haven't done much traveling but I have been to Mexico at Cabo san Lucas.
Also have been to Iceland.
Iceland is beautiful. Every thing from the people to the landscape.
Hopefully when Covid is over and school is done I can expand my travels.
